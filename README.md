# LinearAlgebra

A general-purpose header-only linear algebra library.

This is developed in tandem while working through [MIT OpenCourseWare's 18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) - thanks MIT and Professor Strang!  Coding and documenting the data structures and operations aided with internalization of the concepts. 

## Usage

A convenience build script is also provided, for building all targets, and optionally installing to a location:
```
./build.sh <OPTIONAL_INSTALL_LOCATION>
```

## Documentation

Doxygen documentation based on the latest state of master, [hosted by GitHub Pages](https://moddyz.github.io/LinearAlgebra/).
