\section LinearAlgebra_Introduction Introduction

**LinearAlgebra** is general-purpose header-only linear algebra library.

This is developed in tandem while working through MIT OpenCourseWare's 18.06.  Coding and documenting the data structures and operations aided with internalization of the concepts.

See [README.md: Example Usage](https://github.com/moddyz/LinearAlgebra#example-usage) for example usage.

\subsection LinearAlgebra_DeveloperNotes_SourceTree Source Tree
